 * provides an event-based interface for use. The resultant output are either UpEvents or DownEvents
 * corresponding to whether the button has been pushed-down or released.
 *
 * Be aware that the ButtonsInit() function exists for configuring the appropriate pins on the PIC
 * processor and must be done before ButtonsCheckEvents() will work.

/**
 * This function checks the button states and returns any events that have occured since the last
 * call. In the case of the first call to ButtonsCheckEvents() after ButtonsInit(), the function
 * should assume that the buttons start in an off state with value 0. Therefore if no buttons are
 * pressed when ButtonsCheckEvents() is first called, BUTTONS_EVENT_NONE should be returned. The
 * events are listed in the ButtonEventFlags enum at the top of this file. This function should be
 * called repeatedly.
 *
 * This function also performs debouncing of the buttons. Every time ButtonsCheckEvents() is called,
 * all button values are saved, up to the 4th sample in the past, so 4 past samples and the present
 * values. A button event is triggered if the newest 4 samples are the same and different from the
 * oldest sample. For example, if button 1 was originally down, button 1 must appear to be up for 4
 * samples and the last BTN3 event was BUTTON_EVENT_3DOWN before a BUTTON_EVENT_1UP is triggered. 
 * This eliminates button bounce, where the button may quickly oscillate between the ON and OFF state
 * as it's being pressed or released.
 *
 * NOTE: This will not work properly without ButtonsInit() being called beforehand.
 * @return A bitwise-ORing of the constants in the ButtonEventFlags enum or BUTTON_EVENT_NONE if no
 *         event has occurred.
